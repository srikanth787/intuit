In AWS, using automation (cloudformation, troposphere or terraform or equivalent) and configuration management (Chef or puppet or Ansible or equivalent), create an application stack and do the following: 
1. Install any JDK8 version 
2. Install any Tomcat8 version 
3. Install any Nginx version 
4. Configure Nginx as the front end to the java app, which listens on port 80 and 443. 
5. Application should print "Hello World" via browser using user-friendly hostname. 
6. Keep security, scalability, manageability and availability of your application in mind while building this application stack. 
7. Integrate RDS with this application 
8. Fetch "Hello World" from RDS and show it via the browser using user-friendly hostname.
